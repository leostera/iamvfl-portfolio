=========

This is the project for my new portfolio site which will be available [here](http://www.iamvfl.com) once it is complete. It features a redesign and a pretty nifty stack:
- Node
- Express
- MongoDB
- Grunt
- Angular
- HTML5 & CSS3


The functionality of the site itself isn't overly impressive, though the execution is the important part. The client and server are largely decoupled, and we're also consuming APIs for services like Twitter and GitHub.
